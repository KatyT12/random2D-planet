This is a simple program that randomly generates a 2D planet. It is part of a larger project I am part way through in having a whole randomly generated galaxy

It uses the olcpixelgameengine https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

Press ENTER to generate a new planet.

Build and run on Linux:

cd Build

cmake ..

make

./main

Or if you want to have this program ran as a shell command in the terminal you can run install.sh


note that this script will move the executable to /usr/bin so it will need to be ran with admin privileges


sudo ./install.sh (name) 

With name being whatever you would like the name of the command to be
